## Product Specification

A SPA that:

- Tabulates the given data and makes it navigable.
- Allows filtering and sorting of columns.
- Presents statistical overview.

### User Stories

As derived from the requirements given in the assessment.

- As a user, I want my planning data in tabular view so that I can browse through it.
- As a user, I want to get a graphical representation of at least one of:
  - booking grade
  - office city
  - skill
  - industry,

so that I can tell how large or small a given item in the category is.

- As a user, I want to enter some text in a textfield and click a button so that I can filter the data by my entered text, on the table.
- As a user, I want to click a column heading on the table so that I can sort the data by that name in ascending order.
- As a user, I want to click the `skills` column heading on the table so that I can sort the data by number of `requiredSkills`, highest to lowest.

## Skills I demonstrated

- State management using React hooks
- Static type-checking with TypeScript
- Pagination, sorting and filtering of a fairly large dataset
